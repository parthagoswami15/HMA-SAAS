## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Duplicate Icon Declarations

The build is failing because some icons are declared twice in the shim file.

**File:** `apps/web/src/shims/tabler-icons.tsx`

---

## üîß MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Open the file
Open `apps/web/src/shims/tabler-icons.tsx`

### Step 2: Find and remove duplicates

Search for these icons and **remove the SECOND occurrence** (keep the first one):

1. **IconTool** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 207)
2. **IconDeviceDesktop** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 208)
3. **IconPhoto** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 200)
4. **IconPlayerPlay** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 201)
5. **IconPlayerPause** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 202)
6. **IconRotate** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 203)
7. **IconBrightness** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 204)
8. **IconAdjustments** - Appears twice (remove the one around line 205)

### Step 3: How to find duplicates

Use your editor's search function (Ctrl+F) and search for each icon name.
If it appears twice, delete the SECOND occurrence.
