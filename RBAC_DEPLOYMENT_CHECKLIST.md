# RBAC Deployment Checklist

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Verification
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
- [ ] Database connection string is correct in `.env`
- [ ] Backend server (NestJS) can connect to database
- [ ] Node.js version >= 18.x
- [ ] npm/pnpm is installed

### Backup (Recommended)
- [ ] Create database backup before migration
  ```bash
  pg_dump -U postgres -d hms_db > backup_before_rbac_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
  ```
- [ ] Document current user count and roles
- [ ] Note existing tenant IDs

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
cd apps/api

# Generate migration (creates SQL file)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_rbac_system --create-only

# Review the generated migration file
# Location: apps/api/prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_rbac_system/migration.sql

# Apply migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check new tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('permissions', 'tenant_roles', 'role_permissions');

-- Should return 3 rows
```

- [ ] Migration generated successfully
- [ ] Migration SQL reviewed
- [ ] Migration applied without errors
- [ ] Prisma Client generated
- [ ] New tables verified in database

---

### Step 2: Seed Permissions and Roles

```bash
cd apps/api

# Run seed script
npx ts-node prisma/seeds/index.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🌱 Seeding permissions...
✅ Successfully seeded 100+ permissions

🌱 Creating default roles for existing tenants...
Found X active tenants
Processing tenant: Hospital A
✅ Created Admin role with 100+ permissions for Hospital A
✅ Assigned Admin role to Y admin users in Hospital A
...
✅ Default role seeding completed successfully
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check permissions count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM permissions;
-- Should be 100+

-- Check roles created
SELECT t.name as tenant, tr.name as role, COUNT(rp.id) as permission_count
FROM tenant_roles tr
JOIN tenants t ON tr.tenant_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN role_permissions rp ON tr.id = rp.role_id
GROUP BY t.name, tr.name;

-- Check users with roles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role_id IS NOT NULL;
```

- [ ] Seed script ran without errors
- [ ] 100+ permissions created
- [ ] Admin role created for each tenant
- [ ] Permissions assigned to Admin roles
- [ ] Existing admin users have roleId assigned

---

### Step 3: Rebuild Backend

```bash
cd apps/api

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Or start in development mode
npm run start:dev
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check server starts without errors
# Look for:
# - "Nest application successfully started"
# - No TypeScript compilation errors
# - RbacModule loaded
```

- [ ] Backend builds successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] RbacModule loaded in logs

---

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Get auth token first
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@hospital.com","password":"your_password"}' \
  | jq -r '.accessToken')

# Test permissions endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/permissions

# Test roles endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/roles

# Test creating a role
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Role",
    "description": "Test role for verification",
    "permissionIds": [],
    "isActive": true
  }'
```

**Expected Results:**
- Permissions endpoint returns array of 100+ permissions
- Roles endpoint returns array with at least Admin role
- Create role returns new role object

- [ ] GET /permissions works
- [ ] GET /roles works
- [ ] POST /roles works
- [ ] JWT token includes permissions
- [ ] No 403/401 errors for admin user

---

### Step 5: Verify Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Manual Testing:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/roles` (or 3002)
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Verify role management page loads
4. Check stats dashboard shows correct counts
5. Try creating a test role
6. Try editing a role
7. Try deleting the test role

- [ ] Frontend builds successfully
- [ ] Can access /dashboard/roles page
- [ ] Stats dashboard shows correct data
- [ ] Can create new role
- [ ] Can edit role
- [ ] Can delete role (if no users)
- [ ] Permission selection works
- [ ] UI is responsive and functional

---

### Step 6: Security Verification

**Test Permission Guard:**
```bash
# Create a user with limited permissions
# Try to access protected endpoint
# Should get 403 Forbidden

# Example: User without roles.view tries to access /roles
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIMITED_USER_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/roles
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

**Test Tenant Isolation:**
```sql
-- Verify user from Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's roles
-- Login as Tenant A user
-- Query should only return Tenant A roles
```

**Test System Role Protection:**
```bash
# Try to delete Admin role
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/roles/$ADMIN_ROLE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden (system role)
```

- [ ] Permission guard blocks unauthorized access
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified
- [ ] System roles cannot be deleted
- [ ] Roles with users cannot be deleted
- [ ] Audit logs created for RBAC operations

---

### Step 7: User Migration (Optional)

If you want to assign roles to existing users:

```sql
-- Find users without roles
SELECT id, email, role, tenant_id 
FROM users 
WHERE role_id IS NULL 
AND is_active = true;

-- Get role IDs for each tenant
SELECT tr.id, tr.name, t.name as tenant
FROM tenant_roles tr
JOIN tenants t ON tr.tenant_id = t.id;

-- Assign roles based on existing role enum
UPDATE users 
SET role_id = (
  SELECT id FROM tenant_roles 
  WHERE tenant_id = users.tenant_id 
  AND name = 'Admin'
)
WHERE role IN ('ADMIN', 'HOSPITAL_ADMIN')
AND role_id IS NULL;

-- Create and assign other roles as needed
```

- [ ] Identified users needing role assignment
- [ ] Created necessary roles for tenant
- [ ] Assigned roles to users
- [ ] Verified role assignments

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### Database Health Check

```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM permissions;        -- Should be 100+
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenant_roles;       -- At least 1 per tenant
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_permissions;   -- Many records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role_id IS NOT NULL;  -- Admin users

-- Check data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_permissions rp
LEFT JOIN tenant_roles tr ON rp.role_id = tr.id
WHERE tr.id IS NULL;
-- Should be 0 (no orphaned records)

-- Check audit logs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action LIKE 'ROLE_%';
-- Should have records from seeding
```

- [ ] All tables have expected record counts
- [ ] No orphaned records
- [ ] Audit logs contain RBAC operations
- [ ] Foreign key constraints working

---

### API Health Check

```bash
# Test all RBAC endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/permissions/categories
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/roles
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/roles/$ROLE_ID
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/roles/$ROLE_ID/permissions
```

- [ ] All endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Response data is correct
- [ ] No server errors in logs
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

---

### Frontend Health Check

- [ ] Role management page loads without errors
- [ ] Can view all roles
- [ ] Can create new role
- [ ] Can edit existing role
- [ ] Can delete role (when allowed)
- [ ] Permission selection works
- [ ] Stats dashboard accurate
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] UI is responsive

---

### User Experience Check

**Login as Different Users:**

1. **Admin User**
   - [ ] Can access all features
   - [ ] Can manage roles
   - [ ] Can assign permissions
   - [ ] Can assign roles to users

2. **Limited User** (if created)
   - [ ] Cannot access restricted features
   - [ ] Gets clear error messages
   - [ ] UI hides unauthorized actions
   - [ ] Navigation filtered by permissions

3. **New User** (create test user)
   - [ ] Can be assigned a role
   - [ ] Permissions apply immediately after login
   - [ ] Can access permitted features
   - [ ] Cannot access restricted features

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Issues Occur:

1. **Restore Database Backup**
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d hms_db < backup_before_rbac_YYYYMMDD.sql
   ```

2. **Revert Code Changes**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit_hash>
   ```

3. **Remove Migration**
   ```bash
   # Delete migration file
   rm -rf apps/api/prisma/migrations/*_add_rbac_system
   
   # Reset Prisma
   npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration_name>
   ```

**Note:** Rollback is safe because:
- All changes are additive (no data deleted)
- Foreign keys use `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Existing auth flows unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing code
