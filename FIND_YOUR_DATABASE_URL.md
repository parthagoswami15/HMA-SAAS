# üîç Find Your Database Connection String

## You Have a User - Let's Connect to YOUR Database!

Since you mentioned you have a user created, you need to use **your own database connection string**, not the one from the handover document.

---

## Step 1: Log into Your Supabase Account

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Log in with your account
3. You should see your project(s)

---

## Step 2: Open Your Project

Click on the project where you created your user (probably named something like "HMS", "Hospital", etc.)

---

## Step 3: Get Connection String

### Option A: Transaction Pooler (Recommended)

1. Click **Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon in bottom left)
2. Click **Database** from the left menu
3. Scroll down to **Connection string**
4. Select **Transaction** tab
5. Click the **URI** format
6. Copy the entire connection string

It looks like:
```
postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Option B: Direct Connection

1. Same steps as above
2. But select **Session** tab instead
3. Copy that connection string

It looks like:
```
postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password!

---

## Step 4: Update Your .env File

1. Open: `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\HMS\apps\api\.env`
2. Find the line starting with `DATABASE_URL=`
3. Replace it with your copied connection string

Example:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.abcdefghijk:MySecurePass123@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

---

## Step 5: Restart Backend

```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server, then:
npm run start:dev
```

---

## Alternative: If You Don't Know Your Supabase Account

### Check if there's a different .env file:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\HMS
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ".env*" | Select-Object FullName
```

This will show all .env files. Check if there's another one with the correct database URL.

## Still Having Issues?

### Try This Quick Test:

Can you access your Supabase project at all? 

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Log in
3. Can you see your project?
4. Can you see the "Table Editor" with your user data?

If YES ‚Üí Follow steps above to get connection string  
If NO ‚Üí You might need to create a new Supabase project

---

## Need the Database Password?

If you forgot your database password:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Database**
3. Scroll to **Database password**
4. Click **Reset database password**
5. Copy the new password
6. Update your connection string with new password

---

## Quick Commands After Updating .env

```powershell
# 1. Stop current server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Regenerate Prisma client with new database
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\HMS\apps\api
npx prisma generate

# 3. Start server
npm run start:dev
```

---

## What's Happening?

The error "Tenant or user not found" means:
- The connection string in your .env is pointing to someone else's database
- You need to update it to point to YOUR database where your user exists

Once you update the DATABASE_URL to your actual database, everything will work! üöÄ
