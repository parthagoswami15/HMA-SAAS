# HR Page Type Errors Summary

## Issue

The HR page has 60+ TypeScript errors because the mock data structure doesn't match the type definitions from `../../../types/hr`.

## Root Cause

- Mock data has properties like `employee.role`, `employee.joinDate`, `employee.salary` that don't exist in the `Employee` type
- Mock data has `payroll.employee`, `payroll.payPeriodStart`, `payroll.baseSalary` that don't exist in the `Payroll` type
- Mock data has `leave.employee`, `leave.duration`, `leave.appliedDate` that don't exist in the `LeaveRequest` type
- Mock data has `training.trainingName`, `training.participants`, `training.maxParticipants` that don't exist in the `Training` type
- Mock data has `mockHRStats.monthlyHiring`, `mockHRStats.attendanceData`, etc. that don't exist in `HRStats` type

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix Type Definitions (Recommended)

Update the type definitions in `../../../types/hr.ts` to match the actual mock data structure.

### Option 2: Fix Mock Data

Update the mock data in `../../../lib/mockData/hr.ts` to match the type definitions.

### Option 3: Use Type Assertions (Quick Fix)

Add `as any` type assertions throughout the component where type mismatches occur. This bypasses TypeScript checks but allows the app to run.

## Recommendation

Since this appears to be a prototype/demo with mock data, **Option 3** is the quickest solution to get the app running. For production, **Option 1** or **Option 2** should be implemented to ensure type safety.
