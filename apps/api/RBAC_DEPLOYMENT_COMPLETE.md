- ✅ Assigned all 76 permissions to Admin role

### 4. **Backend Fixes** ✅

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. **Start the Backend**
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run start:dev
```

The backend should now start without errors!

### 2. **Test RBAC Endpoints**

**Get all permissions:**
```bash
GET /rbac/permissions
```

**Get all roles for a tenant:**
```bash
GET /rbac/roles
```

**Assign role to user:**
```bash
POST /rbac/roles/:roleId/users/:userId
```

**Check user permissions:**
```bash
GET /rbac/permissions/user/:userId
```

### 3. **Use Permission Guards**

In your controllers, use the `@RequirePermissions()` decorator:

```typescript
import { RequirePermissions } from './rbac/decorators/require-permissions.decorator';

@Get('patients')
@RequirePermissions('patient.view')
async getPatients() {
  // Only users with 'patient.view' permission can access
}
```

### 4. **Frontend Integration**

Use the permission helper functions:

```typescript
import { hasPermission } from '@/lib/permissions';

if (hasPermission(user, 'patient.create')) {
  // Show create patient button
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Subscription Module Disabled
The subscription module has been temporarily disabled because it references models that don't exist in the Prisma schema:
- `subscription`
- `subscriptionPlan`
- Invoice fields: `subscriptionId`, `amount`, `paidAt`

**To re-enable:**
1. Add subscription models to Prisma schema
2. Run `npx prisma generate`
3. Uncomment `SubscriptionModule` in `app.module.ts`
