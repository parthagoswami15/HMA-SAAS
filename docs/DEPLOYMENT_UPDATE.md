# ✅ UPDATED: Render Deployment Configuration

## 🔄 Changes Made

I've updated all configuration files with your **correct Supabase database credentials**:

### Updated DATABASE_URL:
```
postgresql://postgres:9800975588pG@db.uoxyyqbwuzjraxhaypko.supabase.co:5432/postgres?schema=public
```

## 📁 Files Updated:

### 1. ✅ `render-deploy.yaml` (MAIN DEPLOYMENT FILE)
- Updated DATABASE_URL with correct password and host
- **Use this file for deployment**

### 2. ✅ `render-supabase.yaml`
- Updated DATABASE_URL for consistency

### 3. ✅ `apps/api/.env.production`
- Updated production environment file

### 4. ✅ `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_FIXED.md`
- Updated deployment guide with correct information

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Since you've already updated the DATABASE_URL in your Render environment tab, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Render Environment Variables (RECOMMENDED)
Since you've already set the DATABASE_URL in Render's environment tab, you can:

1. **Keep your current Render environment variable as is**
2. **Remove the DATABASE_URL line from your YAML file** or set it to `sync: false`
3. **Deploy using the updated configuration**

### Option 2: Use YAML Configuration
Use the updated `render-deploy.yaml` file which now has the correct DATABASE_URL.

## 🔐 Correct Database Connection String

Your correct connection details:
- **Host**: `db.uoxyyqbwuzjraxhaypko.supabase.co`
- **Database**: `postgres`
- **Username**: `postgres`
- **Password**: `9800975588pG`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Schema**: `public`

## ⚠️ Important Note

Since you've already set the DATABASE_URL in Render's environment tab, that will take precedence over the YAML configuration. The deployment should work with your manually set environment variable.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy your application** using the current configuration
2. **Check the deployment logs** to ensure database connection is successful
3. **Test the health endpoint** once deployed
4. **Verify database connectivity** by testing your API endpoints

Your configuration is now correctly aligned with your actual Supabase database credentials!

## 📋 Quick Verification

After deployment, you can verify the connection by:
1. Checking deployment logs for successful database connection
2. Testing the `/health` endpoint
3. Attempting to create/read data through your API

The database URL format is now correct and should establish a proper connection to your Supabase PostgreSQL database.
