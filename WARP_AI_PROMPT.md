# 🏥 HMS SAAS Development Continuation - Warp AI Prompt

## 🎯 Current Status & Context

I have a **Hospital Management System (HMS) SaaS** project that is **working locally** with:
- ✅ Authentication system (signup/login) - **WORKING**
- ✅ Enhanced dashboard with HMS module overview - **WORKING** 
- ✅ Patient management (full CRUD) - **WORKING**
- ✅ Supabase PostgreSQL database - **CONNECTED**
- ✅ Backend APIs (NestJS) - **RUNNING ON PORT 3001**
- ✅ Frontend (Next.js) - **RUNNING ON PORT 3000**

## 🚀 What I Need You to Do

**Continue building the HMS modules** using the existing working foundation. Focus on implementing the core hospital management features that are currently showing as module cards on the dashboard.

### 📋 Priority HMS Modules to Build:

1. **Appointments Management Frontend** (Backend API already exists)
   - Appointment booking interface
   - Calendar view for appointments
   - Doctor availability checking
   - Appointment status management

2. **Staff Management Module**
   - Doctor profiles and specializations
   - Nurse management
   - Staff scheduling
   - Role-based access

3. **OPD (Outpatient Department) Management**
   - Patient check-in/check-out
   - Queue management
   - Consultation records

4. **IPD (Inpatient Department) Management** 
   - Bed management
   - Patient admission/discharge
   - Room assignments

5. **Laboratory Module**
   - Test orders and results
   - Lab report generation
   - Sample tracking

6. **Pharmacy Module**
   - Medicine inventory
   - Prescription dispensing
   - Stock management

## 🛠️ Technical Guidelines

### Use Existing Architecture:
- **Backend**: NestJS with Prisma ORM (same pattern as patients module)
- **Frontend**: Next.js with inline styles (no external UI libraries)
- **Database**: Continue using existing Supabase connection
- **API Pattern**: Follow the existing `/patients/*` endpoint structure

### Development Approach:
1. **Start with one module at a time**
2. **Create backend controller + service first** (follow patients.controller.ts pattern)
3. **Build frontend UI second** (follow dashboard/patients/simple-page.tsx pattern)
4. **Test locally before moving to next module**

### File Structure to Follow:
```
apps/api/src/
├── [module-name]/
│   ├── [module].controller.ts
│   ├── [module].service.ts  
│   ├── [module].module.ts
│   └── dto/[module].dto.ts

apps/web/src/app/dashboard/
└── [module-name]/
    └── page.tsx
```

## 📊 Database Schema Available

The Prisma schema already includes comprehensive models for:
- Users, Patients, Appointments ✅
- Prescriptions, Medical Records
- Invoices, Payments (billing)
- Medications, Labs, Radiology
- Staff, Departments
- And more...

**Check `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` for all available models.**

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Both services are configured and working:
- **Backend**: Use `apps/api/start-local.bat` 
- **Frontend**: Use `apps/web/start-local.bat`
- **Database**: Supabase connection is already configured

## 💡 Key Requirements

1. **Keep it consistent** with existing code patterns
2. **Use inline styles** (no external CSS frameworks)
3. **Focus on functionality** over fancy UI
4. **Test each module** as you build it
5. **Don't change** existing working authentication or patient management

## 🎯 Specific Starting Point

**Begin with Appointments Management Frontend** since the backend API already exists (`/appointments/*`). Create:
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx`
- Appointment booking form
- List view of appointments
- Calendar view integration

The backend already has all these endpoints ready:
- `GET /appointments` - List appointments
- `POST /appointments` - Create appointment  
- `GET /appointments/calendar` - Calendar view
- `PUT /appointments/:id` - Update appointment

## ⚠️ What NOT to Touch

- Don't modify existing auth system
- Don't change patient management 
- Don't alter database connection
- Don't deploy to external services yet
- Don't add external dependencies

## 🏃‍♂️ Ready to Start?

The project is **ready for immediate development**. All dependencies are installed, services are configured, and the foundation is solid. Just pick up from where we left off and start building the next HMS module!
